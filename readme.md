# Movie & Meal

## Description
The web page will generate a randomly selected movie and meal for the end user to watch and make when the random button is selected. For the meals, it will include the Recipe Name, how long it takes to cook, the ingredients list, and the steps to make it. For the movies, it will include movie title, movie genre, the run time, and a brief synopsis.

This is for those of us who can't decide on a movie to watch and/or a meal to make. This is a useful tool for busy adults who have come home from work or school and just want some of the decision to be chosen for them. This was a great lesson in all of the subjects we have learned so far: html, css, javascript, and APIs and gives the team the confidence to create their own websites with multiple functions in the future.

## Usage
- under "Find some tasty Recipes", search for what you would like the recipe to have (for example: chicken, beef, fish, etc).
- under "Choose a movie genre", choose from the drop down menu what genre of movie you would like
- Click the submit button to see your results
- On the results page, you can click the button Add to Favorites to save the movie/meal for later
- Click on the favorites button on the navigation bar to see your saved favorites
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
